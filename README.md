# iOS_Blockchain_Prototype
It's about Bitcoins Transaction. 
The app has Two Bitcoin Wallets. It sends bitcoins to the other account using the send button and to earn BTC, we can press the Mine button which will give us some rewards.  
We can see the Prototype of Blockchain System in the console. 
For each transaction, Blocks' records are printed e.g. Hash, Data, Previous Block Hash and Transaction is valid or not.  
Separate functions have been created for handling the Transactions, printing in console and Blockchain verification. 
Currently, this is not a Decentralised App.
